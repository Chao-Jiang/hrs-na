We (Rita M Ludwig & Sara J Weston) are posting this network psychometrics code in order to receive peer feedback prior to running it as part of our study on the Health & Retirement Survey data. We will close our code to public review on May 15th, 2019. After this period we will proceed with pre-registration of our study on the Open Science Framework at the project page, https://osf.io/r9wz3/.

In this script we heavily adapt code from Constantini et al., 2019*. We simulate data to run as a stand-in for our primary dataset, which will contain three waves of responses to 68 items. 

We would appreciate comments on:
* Our general study design - do these data seem appropriate to use with this approach?
* Analysis specifics - are there arguments or parameters we could tune to get better fidelity out of the analyses?
* Our code - are there any obvious issues that we might have missed? is everything working?

Comments/suggestions on the code can be submitted as issues directly on the github repo, https://github.com/rxqx/hrs-na, or via an email to rludwig@uoregon.edu.

We appreciate your attention and your time - thank you for looking this over!
